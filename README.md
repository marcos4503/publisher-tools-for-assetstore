# Privacy/Security Notice

This extension does not collect any type of personal data from the user and neither stores nor sends them to other servers. The only data the Extension stores is your Reviews RSS URL and your Publisher ID. This data is used only to contact the Unity API and obtain your sales data.
<br>
<br>
The extension can only contact the API and Unity Servers, if your Browser is currently logged into the Unity Publisher Portal. The extension does not read any kind of Cookies or personal data, however, whenever it contacts Unity servers and its APIs, it just sends a Request to the servers and instructs your Browser to send session Cookies and other data needed, so when the servers return a response, the extension reads and interprets them.
