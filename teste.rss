<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Pretty Much Perfect&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;MT Assets has not only produced a solid asset that works as advertised, he has also taken the time to carefully document the various possibilities for how it can be tailored specifically to your use. In addition the numerous reviews about excellent customer service are spot-on! Punctual and precise support from the author makes this asset easily double the value in my opinion. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Worth its price!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Really easy to use, ULOD generates the LOD really quickly and saves the game&#x27;s performance. It even perfectly works with animated Skinned Mesh Renderer!

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;SUPER ASSET&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Very easy to learn and use. Combining several meshes in only one click and it is done. If you don&#x27;t like it you can simply undo and change you combination. Even if you are careless about using different metarials for different meshes; this product still increases the performance by x2. If you know what you are doing and trying to use the same material for different meshes, with this product, it is possible to get the x 8 - 9 performance. Support is great, they are standing behind their asset and answering every question in detail.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Runtime Mesh Combining &#x26; Excellent Support!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I bought this asset for its Runtime Mesh Combining support. I am using Playmaker for my scripting and it was very easy to implement what I wanted. Simply add &#x22;Skinned Mesh Combiner&#x22; component on your character, when you want to Combine, &#x22;Call Method (attach the component) &#x3E; CombineMeshes()&#x22;. It combines, it is extremely easy to work with the tool for Runtime combining purposes. 5 Stars for delivering what I needed perfectly. EDIT: Further, I needed support for a reason and the developer was very quick to respond and fix my problem, this is a perfect buy! &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>Updated reply to review of package &#x22;Easy Minimap System MT&#x22;  by rubydev</title>
<link>http://u3d.as/1C6z</link>
<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Reply from publisher&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi! :) I am currently working on a new version of the Easy Minimap System, in this new version, the asset is undergoing several changes and MANY improvements. In addition there are several additions and even new components that will be very useful! In the new version I&#x27;m working on, it includes improvements and updates to existing components. I highly appreciate any feedback on any of my assets, and I encourage you to contact me by email (mtassets@windsoft.xyz) if you have more feedbacks! If I understand correctly, you would like to configure the Minimap Camera component to follow the rotation of another GameObject, correct? Currently it is completely possible to use the Easy Minimap System for third-person games as well (including shoorters, 2d top down, and several other genres), just insert the Minimap Camera component in the correct location and it should be able to do everything! In the next version I will include 2 scenes demonstrating the use of the Easy Minimap System, 1 scene demonstrating its operation in FPS games and another scene demonstrating its operation in third person games! I believe that this will help people even more, with the understanding of the tool! Undoubtedly your feedback on this review was helpful! :) However, thank you very much for the great evaluation and feel free to contact me whenever you want! Cheers! PS: I&#x27;m working on a GPS route system for the Easy Minimap System and also major improvements for third-person games! One of them is the possibility to configure a minimap component, to follow the rotation of another GameObject of your choice!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Work&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;It can bake a minimap image from above and it&#x27;s really easy to do. It&#x27;s much more performant approach than using a second real-time camera other minimap system use. Still some things could be better, for example there is a smoothing for rotation, but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t applies to north so I&#x27;ve turned north off as it de-syncs. More major issue for me is that for third person you don&#x27;t have separate objects for a camera and a player. So if you move a camera around a player and bind a minimap to player&#x27;s rotation it doesn&#x27;t rotate at all. And if you bind minimap to track a camera it doesn&#x27;t places a player in the centre. I would like it to be able to track centre from one object (player) and a rotation from other one (camera). Still it&#x27;s suitable for 2d top-down, FPS or genres where camera cannot rotate. But not perfect for third person games.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>Updated review of package &#x22;Ultimate LOD System MT&#x22;  by DLively</title>
<link>http://u3d.as/1UvH</link>
<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Stay Clear&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sorry for this review devs... Im working on a refund for this. 1 star seems unfair? But is it? In two hours time I applied this asset to many prefabs (and you can only use it on children, or parent [Not both]) Half the time, the asset doesn&#x27;t work as expected. Just makes a giant pile of mesh (and I tried many configs) So there I was using the undo button and my mesh filters were emptied on objects touched forever ago.. The Colliders were in place, the transform properties untouched, but the mesh squished.. Seriously!? So, 1 star because now I have to update them all manually. updating a prefab doesn&#x27;t do it -- This was supposed to save me time. not clutter my project and cause errors and timeloss. Not a very good experience. Don&#x27;t see how other people are saying what they say.. I didn&#x27;t not have a good experience and I&#x27;m on unity 2020... Wish I saved my money instead.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Amazing and top favorite!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Optimization is Everything. Along with occlusion culling (which honest didn&#x2019;t help much). This have given me a good in increase in FPS. Just wanted to let you know that I knew I had to try out some of your other assets. And I went and got easy mesh combiner. OMG. Beautiful asset. Works amazingly well! I got a 20fps increase.from 15-24fps to 45-60fps. I know it&#x2019;s not much but visually, the difference is immense. I have a lot going on on my screen too but I can always optimize further. But again. Very happy with it. I love that I don&#x2019;t have to delete my original objects since they stay in my hierarchy but their renders get disabled by easy mesh combiner. So I can make changes and rebake. Really shocked I got more FPS. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;ll be even better since my laptop is a &#x201C;budget&#x201D; laptop. On my MacBook I normally get 50-60fps but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll get even more with this. VERY good asset man. Great job! I&#x2019;ll be using this on all my scenes and projects. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Runtime Mesh Combining (Using Playmaker)&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I bought this asset for its Runtime Mesh Combining support. I am using Playmaker for my scripting and it was very easy to implement what I wanted. Simply add &#x22;Skinned Mesh Combiner&#x22; component on your character, when you want to Combine, &#x22;Call Method (attach the component) &#x3E; CombineMeshes()&#x22;. It combines, it is extremely easy to work with the tool for Runtime combining purposes. 5 Stars for delivering what I needed perfectly. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

One regret is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to support more than four Bones on Skin Weight.

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Very good asset in this price. Reduce poly count neatly.&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Though this asset offer complete solution for LOD management but I only needed to reduce polycount of my meshes with in unity without doing decimation in blender etc. And in this regard, this asset does a neat and nice job and I could reduce poly count of my character from 39000 to 5000 without artifacts or holes etc. I can also save simplified meshes as asset or prefabs. Support meshes as well as skinned meshes. The only draw back is that you can not preview the mesh reduction without actually reducing the poly count and replacing the mesh. But the developer has mentioned that this is because unity stability issue. But still I have seen other assets can do this preview thing but they are 5 times expensive than this asset. So for this price lacking this feature is justified. But still it would be very helpful if we could preview mesh reduction without actually simplifying it.

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Buy it&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I added the component to one of my animated animal skinned mesh renderers, chose reduction to 32%, and it created a great looking new mesh in about 2 seconds. Animations still work and the mesh looks great and is wonderfully optimized. I&#x27;ve worked with several decimation tools over the last decade with Unity, and this worked so much better right off the bat. Plus it&#x27;s dead simple to use, which I appreciate. Thanks for the asset, this is going to come in very handy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Reply from publisher&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Thanks for the good review! :) In answer to your question, the Ultimate LOD System currently has 3 camera detection methods. - Main Camera: The camera detected will be the camera with the tag &#x22;MainCamera&#x22;. - Current Camera: ULOD will use a custom algorithm to detect the camera that is currently displayed on the screen, to calculate LODs. - Custom Camera: You can provide a camera of your choice for LODs to be calculated. Currently the Current Camera is the most practical alternative, since ULOD will detect the camera that is currently displayed on the screen, and automatically. If you still have any questions, or need a more detailed explanation, or any tips, please contact my support email! It is always a pleasure to help! mtassets@windsoft.xyz&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;impressive!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The MT Assets developers have impressed me again. Im going to do more tests with this plugin but from what i can see it can handle heavy meshes while other plugins cant. ive tried 4 plugins to reduce my terrain obj mesh and all of them froze unity up.. requiring a Alt tab Delete to close unity. i wasn&#x27;t even going to bother trying it with this asset because it processes the mesh 4 times to create the lods. so i thought for sure this will crash unity of leave me waiting years to complete. but to my surprise this completed whole process in less than 30 seconds. i sh*t you not. PROS 1: in the editor you can zoom in and out and see the lods with the vertex count displayed. Unitys default lod feature doesn&#x27;t show this. 2: Speed is very impressive. 3: Poly reduction is overall very good as long as you dont go over the top with reduction amount. UPDATED: 19th November ok well this dev is just amazing. I love this update. Added the needed features as requested. Im wondering if you will be adding an option to convert your lod setup to unity default? but only after its done its thing and then theres a button to convert. it woud then remove all scripts and references and only have the default unity Lod? CONS 1: it should have an option to convert MT lods to unity default lods. why 5 stars and not less considering the cons. because even with those small negatives it is still superior to all its competitors and much cheaper. And the corners issue is not a problem if you are using skinned meshes... characters, animals etc.. Well done devs. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;not to believe, you NEED to have this!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E; Holy Olympus and all gods. Please what happened here? I have rarely seen an asset that excited me as much as this one! Clever - it does not replace the meshes directly, it creates 1 combination mesh, and then leaves the &#x22;Mesh Renderer&#x22; of the others on &#x22;inactive&#x22;. The increase in performance is unimaginably awesome, even in huge scenes that have no lods. As a tip at the end: put your scene together first, then build the corresponding meshes. About the asset: easy to understand, super easy to use and absolutely flawless! This is how an asset has to be! More sensible than some things that cost more than 50 euros, and the performance gain is just ... wow. TOP!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Short but important&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yes. You can made a Minimap by yourself. This will mean: you will need a lot of coding, and Bugsearch. or you can try an perfect Asset like this! Great Performance, all possibilitys you need. This is just one: a 5 Star! The Price is absolutly amazing, and the Asset works great, out of the Box and errorfree! Clear: 5 Stars!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Great asset with great support&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I was having trouble making LODs for the characters in my game. Ultimate LOD to the rescue! In just a few clicks I had some great looking LODs and the tri count reduction is amazing. I had a couple of small problems and contacted the developer who responded quickly and help me solve both of them. Top notch support!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;just amazing!!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;this is a very easy to use tool and the results are very impressive !! In a scene for Android game I had 30 NPCs and the frame rate was doubtful, between 15 and 20 fps on a mid-range device (moto e6 plus), but after doing the procedure of this great asset with a couple of clicks , the frame rate passed between 28- 33 fps !! only in that scene !! obviously if I want more fps I&#x27;ll remove some NPCs !! in short: it is a great tool and very accessible! 100% recommended without a doubt !! I am totally satisfied! PS: thanks for reading my bible </description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;It helped a lot in my open world project!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I didn&#x27;t expect to have such a significant performance increase on my project, but to my surprise, after generating LODs from my buildings, horizon (including trees, distant mountains, distant clouds, animals, etc.) and etc., my game really stayed more beautiful and performed better! Now I can put a lot more on the screen, without worrying so much about the amount of vertices! This is so good for mobile games! I contacted the developer to ask some questions and the support was also very good! Thank you for that! :)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;One of the best assets for optimization!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;m developing an RPG game where I need to display a large number of objects on the screen, and when the player looks away, I want many things to still appear on the screen, to make the environment more alive and more beautiful, however, after a while adding objects in the scene, things were really beautiful, but my game performance dropped a lot... After researching optimization tips and so on, I came to understand the need to have LODs from my meshes and then I found this beautiful asset! After implementing it in my open world RPG scene, I generated LODs from the objects in my scene and now I can display things very far away, without any problems! In addition, I liked the result so much that I acquired the Easy Mesh Combiner, also published by MT Assets, so I combined the meshes of my scene, the meshes of trees, objects, etc., and generated LODs from the combined meshes and the result was even more impressive! I will probably buy the Skinned Mesh Combiner MT to introduce it to my project! Now I can display distant meshes and almost no performance losses, I loved it!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Reply from publisher&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Thank you very much for this great review! The Ultimate LOD System has just been released, but it sure helped me a lot! A system to define the amount of LODs that the meshes will have, is already underway and should arrive soon, the idea of converting the LODs from ULOD to Unity Default LOD is really a good idea and I will add all the points you mentioned, the my list of things to do! It is always good to hear feedback and know where improvements can be made! I am always open to feedback and working to make my assets even better! Much success and thank you! :)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;impressive!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The MT Assets developers have impressed me again. Im going to do more tests with this plugin but from what i can see it can handle heavy meshes while other plugins cant. ive tried 4 plugins to reduce my terrain obj mesh and all of them froze unity up.. requiring a Alt tab Delete to close unity. i wasn&#x27;t even going to bother trying it with this asset because it processes the mesh 4 times to create the lods. so i thought for sure this will crash unity of leave me waiting years to complete. but to my surprise this completed whole process in less than 30 seconds. i sh*t you not. PROS 1: in the editor you can zoom in and out and see the lods with the vertex count displayed. Unitys default lod feature doesn&#x27;t show this. 2: Speed is very impressive. 3: Poly reduction is overall very good as long as you dont go over the top with reduction amount but there is still room for improvement. but if you poly reduce a plane you will see it cuts the corners off, not keeping the edge intact. not a huge problem but like a said there is room for improvement. CONS 1: doesnt give the option of how many lods to create. 2: it should have an option to convert MT lods to unity default lods. 3: poly reduction needs a little more work with hard edge corners. (not a problem with characters though) why 5 stars and not less considering the cons. because even with those small negatives it is still superior to all its competitors and much cheaper. And the corners issue is not a problem if you are using skinned meshes... characters, animals etc.. Well done devs. &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

BlendShapes support is a feature that is on my to-do list and I plan to bring BlendShapes support to the Skinned Mesh Combiner soon! Thank you very much, be very successful in your projects! :)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;This allows real-time baking. That is a big advantage.&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Almost everything has perfect and affordable. However, it did&#x27;t support blend shapes. In my game, the character face contains many blend shapes. Even if the price goes up, I wish I could support that function.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Its Amazing!! Very Good Support !!!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had some issues first but it was my fault since I had not enabled the write permission for my meshes!! I have contacted the developer and his response fast and very helpful. I had around 700 Batches before this asset. Now I have 6-7 !! It&#x27;s amazing!! Definitely recommended!! &#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rated by user: &#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x26;#9733;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
